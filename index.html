          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Research has shown a link between poverty and poor health. People with more income tend to be healthier and live longer. We know that
            18.5% of the U.S. non-elderly population does not have health insurance, with low-income families especially vulnerable to being uninsured.
            Nearly 70% of the uninsured population is poor or near-poor. The uninsured tend to forego preventative care and to wait until an illness is severe before seeking medical care.</p>

          <p>Low-income communities smoke in much higher numbers than the rest of the country, a disparity that is rooted in many inequities. 
            Individuals who live in low-income communities have the least information about the health hazards of smoking, the fewest resources and social supports, and often the least access to services to help them quit. 
            People living in poverty smoke cigarettes for a duration of nearly twice as many years as people with a family income of three times the poverty rate.
            An estimated 66.6% of daily cigarette smokers living below the poverty level attempt to quit smoking cigarettes compared with 69.9% of those living at or above the poverty level.</p>

          <p>It has been suggested that individuals who live in impoverished regions have poor access to fresh food. Poverty-dense areas are oftentimes called “food deserts,” 
            implying diminished access to fresh food. However, 43% of households with incomes below the poverty line ($21,756) are food insecure (uncertain of having, 
            or unable to acquire, sufficient food) (7). Accordingly, 14% of U.S. counties have more than 1 in 5 individuals use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
            The county-wide utility of the program, as expected, correlates with county-wide poverty rates. Thus, in many poverty-dense regions, people are in hunger and unable 
            to access affordable healthy food, even when funds avail. The double-edged sword of hunger and poor availability of healthy food is, however, unlikely to be the only 
            reason as to why obesity tracks with poverty.</p>
